# English Premier League 2022/2023 Season SCA & GCA Analysis 

## Project Description 

This project is a comprehensive exploration of the Shot Creating Actions (SCA) and Goal Creating Actions (GCA) statistics from the English Premier League during the 2022-2023 season. This project explores both team and player performances to provide key insights and trends related to goal-scoring opportunities and creative playmaking in the English Premier League. In addition, Key performers are highlighted to demonstrate their contribution to a teams succes.

## Objectives

- Evaluate which Premier League teams had the highest levels of shot and goal creation in the 2022/2023 season.
- Identify standout players who contribute significantly to their teams' attacking threat.
- Analyze the types of actions ( passes, shots, take ons, defensive actions) that lead to successful goal scoring opportunities.
- Present findings in a visually engaging manner to provide valuable insights for fans, analysts, and sports enthusiasts.

## Tools & Components 

- SQL Analysis: Utilizing SQL queries to extract and manipulate the SCA and GCA data for teams and players.
- KPI Calculation: Deriving Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to assess player and team contributions.
- Comparative Analysis: Comparing and contrasting teams and players to reveal top performers.
- Power Query
- Power BI Visualization: Creating dynamic and interactive visualizations using Power BI to represent statistics, trends, and insights.

### Limitations

- SCA and GCA statistics may not fully capture the influence of team dynamics, strategies, or tactical changes on individual player performance.
- Injuries or suspensions of key players can significantly affect a team's SCA and GCA metrics, potentially leading to fluctuations in the data.
- Contextual factors like weather conditions, pitch quality, and opponent strength can impact a player's performance, which are not considered in this analysis. 
- Players in different positions have distinct roles, which can affect their SCA and GCA metrics. Failing to account for these positional differences may lead to skewed analysis.
- Team performance can impact individual player statistics. A struggling team may have fewer opportunities for goal creation, affecting certain players' metrics.

### Improvements 

- Incorporating more advanced metrics like xG (Expected Goals) and xA (Expected Assists) to provide a deeper understanding of player and team performance in creating and scoring goals.
- Positional analysis to compare players within the same role (e.g., central midfielders) to gain insights into which positions excel in goal creation and goal-scoring opportunities.
- Analyze how SCA and GCA metrics evolve over the course of the season for players and teams to identify trends and changes in performance.
- Compare the SCA and GCA metrics of Premier League teams and players to those of other top leagues in Europe or historical Premier League seasons for benchmarking.
- Integrate external data sources, such as weather conditions, pitch dimensions, and match location, to account for contextual factors.
