## Power BI Visualizations




### Limitations

- The analysis is based on data from the year 2015. The restaurant industry is highly dynamic, and trends change over time. Therefore, the insights derived may not accurately reflect current market conditions and consumer preferences.
- The analysis relies on data from a single year and a single restaurant. The findings may not be generalizable to other time periods or different types of pizza restaurants, limiting the broader applicability of the insights.
- The project primarily focuses on historical sales and popular menu items. It does not consider other crucial aspects like customer demographics, competition analysis, marketing effectiveness, or the impact of external factors (e.g., economic conditions, local events). 

### Improvements 

- To address the limitations related to data age, it's essential to acquire and analyze more recent data. This would provide a better understanding of current trends and customer behavior, enabling the restaurant to make more relevant decisions.
To gain a more comprehensive view of restaurant performance incorporate additional data sources. Such as, customer demographic information, competitor benchmarking, and marketing campaign information can lead to more holistic insights.
Compare the restaurant's performance with industry benchmarks and best practices. This can highlight areas where the restaurant may be underperforming or where there are opportunities for improvement.
